**Releasing to AMO
**
------------------------------------------

* * *

### Step 1: Make the new version

1.  Bump the version number in 3 files. [Here's an example PR](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay-add-on/pull/375/files).  
    1.  `package.json`
    2.  `package-lock.json`
    3.  `manifest.json`
2.  Commit the version number bump
3.  Create a git tag for the version: `git tag <version>`
4.  Push the tag up to GitHub: `git push --tags`

### Step 2: Add the release notes
------------------------------------------

1.  Run the line below to copy the changelog onto your clipboard. If you're on Windows, use `clip` instead of `pbcopy`
    
       ` git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %s" \[previous version number\]..\[updated version number\] | pbcopy `
    
    **Example:** if updating from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 , then run: ` git log --no-merges --pretty=format:"%h %s" 2.4.0..2.4.1 | pbcopy `
    
      
    
2.  Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay-add-on/releases)
3.  Select ‚ÄòDraft a new release‚Äô
4.  Select the newly created tag
5.  Paste the generated list of commits from your clipboard onto the description field
6.  Clean up the list of commits. Only leave out commits that are significant to the pre-release. For example, remove submodule commits from the list.
7.  Select ‚ÄúThis is a pre-release‚Äù checkbox and publish release.



### Step 3: Configure and generate add on zip files for Firefox
------------------------------------------


1.  Make sure you checkout the newest verison: run `git checkout <version number>`
2.  Run `npm run config:prod` to configure the add on
3.  Run `npm run build:prod` to generate the add on for **Firefox**
5.  In the /`web-ext-artifacts` folder, you should be able to find a zip file of the new release.

        Tip: The `package.json` file has a list of other command helpful command lines


###   Step 4: Submitting to AMO
------------------------------------------

1. Make sure that you have access to edit 'Firefox Relay' on the [AMO developers page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons). Contact Maxx Crawford for file access.

2. Make sure that you have publishing rights granted by AMO themselves (reach out to Andreas Wagner)

  
3. Go to [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/private-relay/edit](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/private-relay/edit) and select **‚ÄúUpload new version‚Äù** on the left side bar

4. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to select ‚Äú**Change**‚Äù under Where to Host Version and select ‚Äú**On this site**‚Äù.

        **WARNING:** If the add on is submitted while set to "_On your own_", you will need to bump the version number (see Step 1: Make the new version) and redo the entire process. This is because version numbers are unique and cannot simply be deleted and edited.

5. Upload the generated zip file in the `/web-ext-artifacts` folder beginning with `firefox_relay` . Do not submit the zip file intended for Chrome.

6. On ‚ÄúDo You Need to Submit Source Code?‚Äù Select "**No**"

7. Summarize the changelog into release notes.

        Note: Only request that the AMO reviewer coordinate with either Maxx Crawford or Tony Cinotto when approving if release date is sensitive. For example, if there is a certain date for marketing.
